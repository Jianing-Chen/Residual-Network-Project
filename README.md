## Residual-Network-Project
This repository is for ECE-7123 Deep Learning Mini-Project1.

This mini project builds a small resnet architecture to classify images from CIFAR10 and archives over 90% accuracy. In the project, we used 7 different individual augmentation strategies including crop, flip, color distort, cutout, rotation and Guassian blur. In the project report we compose different augmentation together with different orders. To realize the composition we need to reconstruct the composition. For example, to build crop + vertical flip we need to build:
